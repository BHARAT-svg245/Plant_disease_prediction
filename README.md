# Plant Disease Prediction App
it is machine learning model to predict wether the crop is having a disease or not on the given weeather conditions.
# Data Description
Plant_disease.csv file have data containing the weather features like-Temperature,Humidity,Soil_Ph,Rainfall.
This dataset is taken from the kaggle machine learning platform.
This dataset have 4 feature and 1000 samples with two classes(0,1).
All features are numerical.
0-No Disease,1-Disease
# Requiremnets
1.Python
2.Python Library-Numpy,Pandas,Scikit-learn,Joblib
3.Matplotlib,Seaborn
# Training And Accuracy
I tried to trained this model by various machine learning algorithms provided in the sk-learn library.
I got the best accuracy by RandomforestClassifier which is 85%.
#Streamlit App
I make a small web app for the users to use this model with the help of streamlit library.
User can enter the inputs in specific range on this app and can check wether these Weather conditions is suitable of not for the crop.
